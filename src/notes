| Location                       | `final` allowed? | `static` allowed? | `static final` allowed? |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------- | ----------------- | ----------------------- |
| **Inside main()**              | ✔ Yes            | ❌ No              | ❌ No                    |
| **Outside main (class level)** | ✔ Yes            | ✔ Yes             | ✔ Yes                   |


❗ Why static cannot be inside a method?

Because inside methods, variables are local—they are stored on the stack and exist only while the method runs.

static means a variable lives as long as the class is loaded, not tied to method execution.
So Java does not allow mixing them:

static final int X = 10;  // ❌ illegal inside main()

3️⃣ Why constructors aren’t inherited
Constructor is tied to creating an object of its own class.
If constructors were inherited, the subclass could be created without calling its own initialization logic, which could break encapsulation.
Hence Java requires explicit super() call or default constructor chaining.
